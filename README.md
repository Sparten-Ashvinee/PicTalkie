# In a Nutshell   
In a nutshell here's how to use this template, so **for example** assume you want to implement ResNet-18 to train mnist, so you should do the following:
- In `modeling`  folder create a python file named whatever you like, here we named it `example_model.py` . In `modeling/__init__.py` file, you can build a function named `build_model` to call your model


   
- In `engine`  folder create a model trainer function and inference function. In trainer function, you need to write the logic of the training process, you can use some third-party library to decrease the repeated stuff.

**You will find a template file and a simple example in the model and trainer folder that shows you how to try your first model simply.**
